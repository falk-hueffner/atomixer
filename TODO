Algorithms:
* MREC
* BDDs?
* Partial IDA*?
* overestimating A* for upper bounds (WIDA* [Kor93])
* Bidirectional search
* Move pruning for backward search
* Move pruning: each move must:
  * move the same atom
  * move an atom that hasn't been moved before
  * or be dependend upon the previous move.

Heuristic:
* identical atoms: minimum cost matching?

Code:
* make Pos() explicit?
