Adapt memory in parameters.hh.

Configure with

./configure

Run with e. g.:

./run.sh levels/katomic_01

Most of the source will be recompiled for each level.

The solver does currently not detect unsolvable levels, so it will run
infinitely on them.

Make sure the level is surrounded by walls. To test if the level gets
parsed correctly, try running atomixer with the --show option.
